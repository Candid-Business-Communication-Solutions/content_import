link_import
===========
Link Import is a working title, since it was with that original purpose in mind that I started writing the module.

In a nutshell, link_import is a Drupal module for importing content from a non-Drupal site into a Drupal site. Instead of copying pages, links, and files by hand, just give the tools a list of URLs, set some options such as importing file types, copying the HTML body of a page into the body of a new node, setting the content type and taxonomy for that node,
etctera.

There may be others out there, but this was something I needed and gave me motivation to learn Drupal module development.
